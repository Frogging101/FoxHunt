FoxHunt v0.1

----------

Use the signal strength indicator shown at the top of the screen to locate
the transmitter hidden in a randomly generated level. There are turrets scattered 
throughout, so be careful.

You start with 3 lives. When you lose a life, you will be sent back to the start
of the level. You die when you run out of health, so avoid getting shot too much!

Use WASD to move your character. Click the mouse on the screen to shoot in that direction.
Every turret destroyed is worth 100 points. Successfully collecting the transmitter will
earn you a bonus of 1250 points. Use alt+f4 to close the game.

Known issues
----------

- Game balance: The game may be too easy or too hard, I didn't have time for a lot of play-testing.
- Your character may get stuck in a wall. Unfortunately, if this happens you must restart
the game. This is a very rare occurrence.
- The game may crash when generating the level. This is a very rare occurrence.
- The code's a bit messy. It's all contained in one file and I didn't do things consistently
and efficiently 100% of the time.
